# Simple-Investment-Calculator

This is a simple investment calculator web-app, for if you have a fixed annual investment. This was written using React, created as a project that is part of my React studies/course.

The React web-app was developed with CodeSandbox. To run in CodeSandbox:
1. Open in CodeSandbox
2. Click the CodeSandbox tab in the side menu
3. Click on Tasks, on "start" click on the Play button.
4. Click on Previews, on "3000" click the Play button. This should display the preview of the web-app.
